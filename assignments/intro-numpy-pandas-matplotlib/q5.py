# 5. How do you Count The Number Of Times Each Value Appears In An Array Of Integers?
#    [0, 5, 4, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 9]
#    Answer should be array([4, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]) 
#    which means 0 comes 4 times, 1 comes 2 times, 2 comes 1 time, 3 comes 1 time and so on.
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

arr = np.array([0, 5, 4, 0, 4, 4, 3, 0, 0, 5, 2, 1, 1, 9])
print(np.bincount(arr))
