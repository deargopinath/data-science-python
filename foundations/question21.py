#  Business challenge/requirement
#  LifeTel Telecom is the latest entrant in the highly competitive Telecom market ...
#
#  Key issues
#  Build a system where when user enters Reference ID it is encrypted, so that hackers 
#  cannot view the mapping of Reference ID and finger print
#
#  Approach to Solve
#  You have to use fundamentals of Python taught in module
#     1. Read the input from command line - Reference ID
#     2. Check for validity â€“ it should be 12 digits and allows on number and alphabet
#     3. Encrypt the Reference ID and print it for reference
#
#  Enhancements for code
#  You can try these enhancements in code
#     1. Allow some special characters in ReferenceID
#     2. Give the option for decryption to user
